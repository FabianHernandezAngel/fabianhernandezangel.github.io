      <p>
        My name is Fabian Hernandez-Angel. I am a senior-year student at Seattle Pacific University studying Computer Science. I started learning to program in my last year of middle school with C# and Unity. A year later I started my first internship where I was introduced to VR game development and it's captivated my interest since.

            Part of my study plan for taking the MongoDB Certified Developer Associate exam was to write a A note-taking application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes stored in a MongoDB database.

          <p>
            I wanted to learn to use another game engine besides Unity, so over the winter I participated in a game jam to create a survival crafting game where players must craft a series of items in under 20-seconds while evading attacks from a monster.

            An entry to the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2022. It was a 3D educational game where players collect samples of moon ragolith and take it back to a greenhouse to grow plants on the moon. This project helped me practice working with team members who weren't familiar with software development and attempting to replicate realistic physics in a game environment.

            My first experience working remotely for a software development internship. Striker was a VR survival pong game where the player must swing a racket to launch the pong ball towards a horde of enemies approaching them. Through this project I learned how to effectively communicate with a remote team while developing my skills in C# and Unity.
